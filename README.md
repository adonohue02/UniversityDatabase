# University Library
The project I created is based on a University Library. The goal was to create a database in MySQL that could be modified using an programming language of our choosing. For this project I decided to program in _Python_. First thing was to create a databse that involved the given information for the University Library. THis was written directly into Mysql so that the tables, and information could be inserted. After completing that,the database from mysql had to be linked by using the command _import mysql.connector_. After that menus and options were created in Python that would allow different actions to produce results from the database, these options included:<br />
**Option 1** Enter the first and last name of a member and recieving the issued id.<br />
**Option 2** Enter a book id and modify the title<br />
**Option 3** Insert a record about a new member<br />
**Option 4** Delete a record about a member<br />
**Option 5** Exit<br />
The overall object of this project was to link the mysql databse to python, and then translate the sql queies into python code.
